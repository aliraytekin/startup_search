# 🧑‍💻 Startup Discovery Platform — Rails + React + TS + PostgreSQL Search

A full-stack web app built to explore and filter startups efficiently using Ruby on Rails (API-only), React (frontend), and PostgreSQL full-text search (pg_search).

# 🧭 What I Learned

- **Composable queries** in Rails can be more elegant than GraphQL if you design scopes well.
- **Debouncing + cancellation** in React gives your UI a “pro” feel with minimal code.
- **TypeScript interfaces (Startup, Location, etc.)** helped me catch dozens of small bugs early — like forgetting optional chaining or mixing up fields.
- **PostgreSQL is underrated:** you can get powerful full-text search without leaving your main database.

Clean architecture pays off — both backend and frontend layers are testable, replaceable, and easy to reason about.

# Overview

This project began as an exploration of how to build a search and filtering platform inspired by real-world startup-scouting tools.
The goal was to design a system where users can:

- Filter startups dynamically by multiple fields (status, category, location, etc.),
- Search by name or keyword efficiently,
- And do all of this through a clean, reactive frontend built with React.

The idea wasn’t just to “get something working” — it was to understand how professional teams structure _data models_, _APIs_, and _client-side filtering systems_ that remain maintainable at scale.

⚙️ Stack & Architecture

- **Backend:** 	Ruby on Rails 7 (API mode) Domain logic, REST API, JSON serialization
- **Database:** PostgreSQL	Relational data, full-text search with pg_search
- **Frontend:**	React + TypeScript Modern SPA with _hooks_, _modular components_, and _search filters_
- **Styling:**	Custom CSS (responsive, app-like design) Layout, cards, and filter bar
- **State management:**	Local React state + custom hooks

Each Startup has:

- One Location (city, region, country),
- One Application (state, category),
- One Contact (state, email status),
- One Review (rating from the user).

# Why I Chose pg_search Over Elasticsearch

At the start, I considered two main paths for implementing full-text search:

**_Option 1: Elasticsearch / Searchkick_**

✅ Excellent scalability for large datasets.
✅ Advanced scoring and fuzzy matching.
❌ Adds another external dependency.
❌ Heavier setup (cluster, sync jobs, reindexing).

_**Option 2: PostgreSQL pg_trgm + pg_search**_

✅ Zero external dependencies — works within Rails + PostgreSQL.
✅ Simple to implement and performant for <100k records.
✅ Supports partial matches (ILIKE) and ranking.
❌ Less powerful ranking and language tokenization than Elasticsearch.

Since this project is focused on learning, iteration, and clean architecture, I chose pg_search — it gives 90% of what I need (fast and flexible queries) without operational overhead.

# 🎨 UI & Design Process

My first version was purely functional — then I rebuilt the UI to feel more like a professional dashboard, with:

- A glassy filter bar,
- Smooth hover transitions and consistent elevation,
- Clean color palettes for badges (info, muted),

I learned that design consistency (spacing and hover feedback) matters as much as logic — it communicates quality.

## Roadmap:

- Create and manage startups (with associated location, application, and contact data)
- Testing	RSpec (Rails)	Model specs for search and scopes (planned extension)
